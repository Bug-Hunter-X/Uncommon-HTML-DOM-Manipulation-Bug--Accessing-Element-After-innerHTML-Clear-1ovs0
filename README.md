# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to DOM manipulation in HTML.  The bug arises when attempting to append a new element to a div immediately after clearing its contents using `innerHTML = ""`.

The problem stems from the fact that the DOM update might not be synchronous.  In other words, the browser might not have fully processed the `innerHTML = ""` operation before the next line of code attempts to modify the same div.

This can lead to unexpected behavior such as the appended element not appearing correctly, or even JavaScript errors.

The solution demonstrates how to handle this by using a small delay (using `setTimeout`) to ensure the DOM updates are fully processed before making further changes.
